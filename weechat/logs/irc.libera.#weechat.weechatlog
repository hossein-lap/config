2021-12-12 01:27:22	primejade	Hi
2021-12-12 01:29:58	primejade	I did setup my nickname, password and sasl in WeeChat first, then I registered them, will this become a problem, or I'm just fine?

2021-12-12 01:34:16	@FlashCode	primejade: this is ok, there's no order to do it
2021-12-12 01:35:31	ksu	primejade: with default settings, weechat won't let you connect to a server if you configured sasl but it doesn't work
2021-12-12 01:35:55	ksu	otherwise it is ok
2021-12-12 01:41:53	topcat001	I am a very basic user of weechat :) I only configure the bare minimum.
