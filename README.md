things I use daily and how they looks
</br>
</br>

<h2>
  note one 
</h2>

<p>
 these configs are what I use with what I installed </br>
 you may have some other things installed 
</p>

<h2>
  note two 
</h2>
<p>
  copy regular directories to <i><b><m>.confing</m></b></i> in your home folder </br>
  and copy the directories with . (dot) directly to your home folder
</p>
